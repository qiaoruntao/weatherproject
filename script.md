Perfect — that’s a strong addition. The **AI Advisor** gives your project a human-interactive edge and fits naturally into your “Our Solution” slide.
Here’s your **updated presentation script** (only modifying the “Our Solution” section, and keeping the rest polished and competition-ready):

## 🗣️ **Updated Oral Presentation Script for “WeatherPreview”**

### **Slide 1 — Title**

> Good morning everyone, we are *Space Wandering*, and our project is called **WeatherPreview**.
>
> Our goal is simple — to help people make quick, confident decisions about outdoor events.
> You know that question we all ask: *“Should I go or not?”*
>
> Well, our tool gives a visual answer to that question — instantly.

---

### **Slide 2 — The Problem We Solve**

> Every day, people plan activities like concerts, parades, or hikes — and they rely on weather forecasts that are often... just not practical.
>
> **First**, the data is *too complex*: things like “0.004 kilograms per square meter per second” don’t mean much to the average person.
>
> **Second**, it’s *too slow*: retrieving large meteorological datasets for multiple cities can take forever.
>
> And **finally**, it’s *too technical*: the data is locked in GRIB files, stored deep in NASA or NOAA archives — something normal users can’t even open.
>
> So, even though the forecast exists, it’s basically inaccessible for most people.

### **Slide 3 — Our Solution**

> Our answer is **WeatherPreview** — a tool that transforms raw, scientific weather data into intuitive, interactive visuals.
>
> In just seconds, users can see — not read — whether it’ll rain, how windy it’ll be, or whether it’s safe to go.
>
> We combine four core elements:
>
> 1. **Global Forecast System (GFS)** — reliable, high-resolution global predictions trusted by professionals.
> 2. **Smart animation layers** — we turn numbers into smooth color-coded motion that looks and feels like weather.
> 3. **Optimized caching and multiprocessing** — our backend handles massive datasets efficiently so everything loads instantly.
> 4. **AI Advisor** — an interactive chatbox that understands the current forecast.
>
>    > Users can simply ask, “Will it rain at the concert tonight?” or “Is it too windy for hiking tomorrow?” — and the AI answers in plain language, based on live forecast data.
>
> Together, these make weather forecasting faster, more understandable, and truly personalized.

---

### **Slide 4 — How It Works**

> Here’s how it works behind the scenes.
>
> **Step 1: Data Fetching.**
> We automatically pull GFS forecast data — rainfall, temperature, and wind — covering the entire planet.
>
> **Step 2: Processing and Indexing.**
> Our backend uses multiprocessing to parse and cache data by time, location, and variable — so future queries load instantly.
>
> **Step 3: Visualization.**
> The frontend turns that data into real-time animations — like rain sweeping across your screen — allowing users to *see* the forecast unfold.
>
> **Step 4: AI Interaction.**
> The AI Advisor connects to this data pipeline and turns scientific output into conversational insight.
> It’s like having your own personal weather expert, available 24/7.

---

### **Slide 5 — Closing**

> In short, **WeatherPreview** bridges the gap between raw science and daily life.
> It makes complex NASA and NOAA data accessible to anyone, anywhere — through clarity, speed, and intelligence.
>
> Because weather shouldn’t be confusing.
> It should just answer one thing: *“Should I go or not?”*
>
> Thank you.

Would you like me to make a **short “judging-round” version** (around 90 seconds total), so you can deliver it smoothly if the host limits your speaking time? It’s common in NASA Space Apps finals.
